1. I installed the packages that i'll be using like redux, thunk, lodash, and moment.
2. I setup the project that i'm going to used.
3. Created components for the header part and used BEM methodoly for CSS and components.
4. for the filter i'm not sure if i'll passing the filter parameters to the request
of what not. So i only used the keywords specifically "rocket_name" for filter.
5. and used lodash filter for it upon submitting the type filter.
6. Its indicated in the email that I can ask about the project itself but I have a little time to do this
because i'm currently working and I think the technical person is not available.

Thank you and let me know if there's some missing or I needed to fix. Have a nice day
